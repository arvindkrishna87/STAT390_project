**Aim: The objective of this project is to identify the severity of potential eye cancer by looking at a particular eye tissue of the patient.**

In medical terms, we want to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify *Conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial lesions **(C-MIL)*** as per the *WHO 2022 classification system*. Providing a reproducible and accurate grading of C-MIL will help doctors select the most appropriate management plan for the patient.

The Northwestern University STAT390 Class of Fall 2024 has made the following progress on this project:

**Step 1:**  Extracting tissue slices from Whole Slice Images (**WSI**) using QuPath

**Step 2:**  Matching tissue slices across the different stains (**H&E, Melan-A, Sox-10**) for each patient when there is a correct match. Then orient matched slices

**Step 3:**  Detecting and extracting the epithelium and stroma for each tissue slice

**Step 4:**  Apply patching across epithelium for matched slices
