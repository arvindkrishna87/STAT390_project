# Methodology

This pipeline automates the preprocessing, matching, alignment, and patch extraction of stained tissue images to enable efficient downstream analysis. The process begins with the preprocessing phase, where images are standardized and organized. Files are renamed to a consistent format, and patients missing one or more strain types (H&E, Melan-A, SOX-10) are excluded. For patients with multiple images of the same strain, only the highest-resolution image is retained. Once cleaned, images are split into folders by patient ID to prepare for further analysis.

The matching phase groups corresponding images across the three stains for each patient by calculating distances between extracted contours to find optimal matches. The aligned images are saved as "matches" and further processed during the alignment phase, where images are rotated and resized to maximize overlap while maintaining consistent dimensions. A contour-based algorithm crops images to their regions of interest before alignment.

Finally, the patch extraction phase identifies and extracts tissue patches containing both epithelium and stroma using skeletonization and gradient-based methods. Each patch is validated to ensure it contains components from all three stain types and meets quality criteria, such as having a balanced proportion of tissue and background pixels. Patches are saved in an organized structure, enabling seamless comparison across stains. The pipeline integrates error handling and modular design to ensure robustness, scalability, and adaptability to varied datasets.

The **rotation code** processes stained tissue images by aligning them spatially, segmenting key regions (epithelium and stroma), and extracting patches for comparative analysis across different stains (H&E, Melan-A, and Sox-10). It begins by aligning images through contour detection, cropping, and optimizing overlap between stains. Using adaptive thresholding and morphological operations, the script segments epithelium and stroma regions based on luminance and chroma channels in the YCrCb color space. Patches containing both regions are extracted along the skeletonized centerline, validated across stains, and saved for further analysis, enabling consistent and meaningful cross-stain comparisons.

Follow this step-by-step manual to match slices. Our API is included which automates the process.

## Step-by-Step Manual (API included)

Two codes required:

-   `pipeline (1).py`

-   `rotate_extract_patch (1).py`

Follow these steps to use the pipeline to generate matching slices for all patients or a specific subset:

To ensure this script works correctly, please follow the instructions below:   

1. Run Cara's automation script to generate the 'processed_images' directory  

2. Ensure that each file is named the same way (with upper and lower case letters): 
          patient ID + strain type + ROI number (separated by underscores)          

3. Run the script `pipeline (1).py` and select the 'processed_images' directory
