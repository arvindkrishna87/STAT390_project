    "text": "Aim: The objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify Conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial lesions (C-MIL) as per the WHO 2022 classification system. In layman’s terms, we want to identify the severity of potential eye cancer by looking at a particular eye tissue of the patient.\nThe motivation behind the project is to provide a reproducible and accurate grading of C-MIL so that the most appropriate management plan for the patient can be developed. By improving the precision of lesion classification, our model has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and optimize treatment strategies\nThe Northwestern University STAT390 Class of Fall 2024 has made the following progress on this project:\n\nExtracting each tissue from the patient data using QuPath\nMatching tissue slices across the different stains (H&E, Melan-A, Sox-10) to each patient if there is a correct match\nDetecting and extracting only the epithelium for each tissue\nPatching certain regions of each epithelium for further examination\nTBD"

Below are some statistics of the data:\n\n60 women (age range: 23-93 years; median 65; mean 61.5) and 37 men (age range: 31-91 years; median 68; mean 66.5)\nThe ethnic group mix comprised of the following: 88 White Caucasian, 4 Black, 2 South Asian, 1 Inuit, 1 Mixed race, and 1 Unspecified\n\nThe data corresponds to patients in the following 3 ocular oncology/pathology centers:\n\nLiverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Liverpool; cases from 2018 to 2021),\nRoyal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield; from 2011 to 2021), and\nRigshospitalet (Copenhagen; from 1996 to 2021)\n\nFor each patient, a tissue is taken from their conjunctiva. The tissue is sliced into multiple slices. Multiple slices are used so that each slice can be analyzed separately and there is more evidence to support the conclusion, i.e., the classification of the C-MIL."
