**Aim: Create a machine learning model to classify slices as low-grade, high-grade, or benign.**

# Model Considerations

Here are some potential steps/directions to consider when creating classification models. 

## Patient demographics:

Using the information from this file [clinical data sheet for scoring.xlsx](clinical data sheet for scoring.xlsx), add patient information including age, gender, ethnicity, laterality, and location of lesion to our ML model. 

## Pattern recognition:

- Note that `low-grade CMIL's` have no-to-mild atypia, and `high-grade CMIL's`have modern-to-sever atypia.
- Ideally, our model needs to be able to identify the distribution and size/shape of melanocytes.
- Once we verify a list of discernible patterns, we can create separate models for specific patterns and then ensemble those models to generate a final classification decision. 

## Melan-A and Sox-10 vs. H&E

Since Melan-A and Sox-10 appear to display melanocyte distribution more clearly than H&E, consider weighing the former two stain types more than the latter when creating our model.
