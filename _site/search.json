Below are some statistics of the data:\n\n60 women (age range: 23-93 years; median 65; mean 61.5) and 37 men (age range: 31-91 years; median 68; mean 66.5)\nThe ethnic group mix comprised of the following: 88 White Caucasian, 4 Black, 2 South Asian, 1 Inuit, 1 Mixed race, and 1 Unspecified\n\nThe data corresponds to patients in the following 3 ocular oncology/pathology centers:\n\nLiverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Liverpool; cases from 2018 to 2021),\nRoyal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield; from 2011 to 2021), and\nRigshospitalet (Copenhagen; from 1996 to 2021)\n\nFor each patient, a tissue is taken from their conjunctiva. The tissue is sliced into multiple slices. Multiple slices are used so that each slice can be analyzed separately and there is more evidence to support the conclusion, i.e., the classification of the C-MIL."
