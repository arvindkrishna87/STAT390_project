## Data overview

[Data Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023683723002246)

Data consists of 105 cases from 97 patients. Below are some statistics of the data:

- 60 women (age range: 23-93 years; median 65; mean 61.5) and 37 men (age range:
31-91 years; median 68; mean 66.5)

- The ethnic group mix comprised of the following: 88 White Caucasian, 4 Black, 2
South Asian, 1 Inuit, 1 Mixed race, and 1 Unspecified

The data corresponds to patients in the following 3 ocular oncology/pathology
centers:

- Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Liverpool; cases from
2018 to 2021),
- Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield; from 2011 to 2021), and
- Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen; from 1996 to 2021)


For each patient, a tissue is taken from their conjunctiva. The tissue is sliced into multiple slices. Multiple slices are used so that each slice can be analyzed separately and there is more evidence to support the conclusion,
i.e., the classification of the C-MIL.
