# Methodology

This project involves a comprehensive image processing workflow designed to segment epithelial and stromal regions from tissue images stained with different markers. The methodology combines advanced image processing techniques, including color space transformations, morphological operations, and region-based segmentation, tailored for specific stain types and locations (e.g., Liverpool or Sheffield). For each image, the script `Epithelium Extraction Script.ipynb` first identifies background regions using the luminance channel. The algorithm then isolates epithelia and stroma using chroma channels, applying binning techniques to detect dominant pixel intensity ranges. Morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, and small object removal refine the segmentation. Gaussian smoothing is incorporated to reduce noise and improve mask quality. Segmented regions are applied as binary masks to the original image for visualization and saved for further analysis. Parameter tuning and function selection were performed iteratively based on intermediate visualizations, ensuring high accuracy for each stain-location combination.

Among the six algorithms implemented, those for H&E stains exhibit the highest accuracy, followed by Melan-A and Sox-10 stains. Each algorithm is adapted to the unique characteristics of the stain and location, ensuring reliable extraction of relevant regions.

The segmentation process for **H&E** stained images leverages the luminance and chroma characteristics of the image to differentiate background, stroma, and epithelial regions effectively. Using the YCrCb color space, the luminance channel identifies the background by isolating the bin with the highest pixel count, refined further through morphological operations like hole filling and object removal. For epithelial segmentation, the red chroma channel is used, with bins adjacent to the stroma bin analyzed to isolate epithelial regions. Morphological techniques, including dilation and Gaussian smoothing, enhance the segmentation mask. The process ensures robust separation of regions, saving the results as masks and visualizations for further analysis. This approach maintains adaptability to the variable staining intensities and patterns characteristic of H&E images.

The methodologies for segmenting and extracting epithelium and stroma regions from tissue images stained with **Melan-A** and **Sox-10** employ similar algorithms but adapt to the unique properties of each stain. Both methods begin by loading the images and converting them to the YCrCb color space to leverage luminance (Y) and chroma (Cr or Cb) channels for segmentation. The background is identified using a binning approach on the luminance channel, isolating the most common intensity bin. Morphological operations like object removal and hole filling refine the background mask, ensuring accurate separation of non-background elements.

For **Melan-A** stains, the red chroma channel is used to identify stroma and epithelium, leveraging bins surrounding the most frequent intensity to segment stroma and bins further offset to isolate epithelium. 

For **Sox-10** stains, the blue chroma channel is used similarly, with a tailored binning strategy to reflect the different chromatic characteristics of this stain. In both cases, stroma and epithelium masks are refined through morphological dilation, Gaussian smoothing, and removal of small objects or holes. The resulting masks are applied to the RGB images to generate segmented outputs, which are saved alongside visualizations of the input, stroma, and epithelium regions. These methods balance robustness and flexibility, ensuring segmentation quality across diverse tissue samples and staining variations.

## Step-by-Step Manual (API included)

Codes required:

- `Epithelium Extraction Script.ipynb`


1. Set the input and output directories: Make sure the paths for the input and output directories are correctly configured to point to the appropriate folders on your computer.

2. Rename files to include locations: Update the file names to include their locations (E.G., h2114189 melan_ROI_1 (Sheffield).tif). This step is essential because the extraction algorithm selection depends on both the stain type and location.

3. Run the setup code: Execute all code cells from the purple header through the end of the file before executing the code cell below. Verify the folder object: Confirm that the folder object contains the correct tissue scans. Once verified, you may execute the code cell below.

4. Run `Epithelium Extraction Script.ipynb`.
