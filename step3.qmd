## Code Explanation

### Separation Process

**Preprocessing and Color Space Transformation**

**Aim:** Convert input images to a color space that separates luminance from chrominance, making it easier to isolate tissue features.

**Input Image:** The original image is loaded as RGB.

**Transformation:** Convert the RGB image to YCrCb. This transformation decomposes the image into:

-   **Y:** Luminance (brightness)

-   **Cr:** Red chroma component

-   **Cb:** Blue chroma component

**Background Detection Aim:** Separate the tissue regions from the background to reduce noise in the analysis.

-   A thresholding technique is applied to the luminance channel to identify low-intensity regions representing the background.

-   Morphological operations are used to remove small noise regions and smooth the background mask.

-   The background mask is then subtracted from subsequent tissue analysis steps.

-   Identifying Stroma using Red Chroma (Cr) Binning

**Aim:** Isolate stroma tissue based on the red chroma component, which correlates well with stromal regions in histology slides.

**Binning of Cr Channel**

-   The Cr component is divided into discrete bins (e.g., 12 bins) to simplify the image analysis.

-   The bin with the maximum number of pixels is identified as the dominant chroma level for stromal regions.

**Stroma Detection**

-   Stroma is defined as the regions within three bins below the dominant bin.

-   A mask is created to isolate stroma areas, followed by dilation to fill gaps.

-   Morphological operations remove small objects and refine the segmentation.

-   The result is saved as a binary mask representing the stroma.

**Identifying Epithelia Using Red Chroma (Cr) Binning Aim:**

-   Differentiate epithelial tissue from stroma using the chroma profile.

**Binning for Epithelia:**

-   Epithelia are identified in the Cr channel bins immediately following the stroma bins.

-   The bins are selected based on their relative position to the previously identified stroma bins.

**Mask Refinement:**

-   Background and stroma regions are subtracted to isolate the epithelia.

-   Further refinement includes removing small objects, filling holes, and eliminating noise caused by blue ink (detected using the Cb channel).

-   The result is saved as a binary mask representing the epithelia.

**Post-Processing and Visualization Aim:**

-   Generate segmented visualizations of the input image with stroma and epithelia overlaid.

**Mask Application:**

-   The segmented stroma and epithelia masks are applied to the original RGB image, producing separate visual representations of each tissue type.

**Segmentation Visualization:**

-   A combined image is generated with three panels:

    -   The original RGB image, the segmented stroma region, the segmented epithelia region

-   These visualizations are saved for further analysis and validation.

**Batch Processing and Cleanup Aim:**

-   Automate the processing for multiple images and optimize memory usage.

**Batch Processing:**

-   The process is set to iterate over a folder of images, applying the segmentation pipeline to each one.

**Memory Management:**

-   To prevent memory overload, unnecessary variables are deleted, and garbage collection is manually triggered at the end of each iteration.
