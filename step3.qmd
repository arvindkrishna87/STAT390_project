Step 3: annotating is happeneing in parallel with Step 4: patching

**Aim: identify different classes in the epithelium so we can train a model with ground truth**

We have sent matched slices to the stakeholder for them to annotate with Benign, Low grade, and High grade C-MIL. This will provide a ground truth for our future model.

In the meantime, we are working on our patching algorithm.
